## Test Plan for requirements:
Since this is a mobile application, all the tests for the requirement can be done on mobile devices. 
R1: Take a picture of a cat and non-cat objects. The app should correctly recognize a cat as a cat, and the app should reject non-cat pictures. Assign statistics to the recognized cats.
R2: Start a battle with selected cats or randomly selected cats.
R3: Search a friend by username and become friends with them. Battle with the friend.
R4: Start a battle. Once the battle is finished, statistics on a cat should be updated.
R5: Login as an admin role. Change statistics of cats and pictures. Once you save a change, the data should be updated.
R6: Log in with unregistered username, which should result in login failure. Create an account and login with the new account. Now the user should be able to play the game.
